# My Personal Blog using Next.js, Contentlayer, TailwindCSS and Vercel

This is my personal blog, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Writing Content

All content is written in Markdown and lives in the `content` directory. The content is structured in a way that makes sense for me, but you can change it to your liking.
