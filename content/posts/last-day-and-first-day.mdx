Friday marked the end of an exciting chapter as I bid farewell to my old job, where I spent three enriching years. It was a fantastic journey, full of learning experiences and collaborations with brilliant minds. As fate would have it, my departure coincided with the launch of a highly anticipated game: [Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon](https://playarmoredcore.com/). Having been captivated by FromSoftware's previous release, Elden Ring, I wasted no time in pre-ordering Armored Core VI when it was first announced. The wait had been long, but now I had all the time in the world to immerse myself in this new gaming adventure.

## Exploring Armored Core VI

Armored Core VI is known for its extensive mech customization options, allowing players to modify their mech with various weapons, armor, and unique components. Not to mention the opportunity to give your mech a personal touch with distinctive paint jobs and decals.

While the game offers a plethora of preset decals, I, being a self-proclaimed terrible artist, decided to seek out decals online. I stumbled upon some impressive designs within the [ArmoredCore Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/armoredcore/), and I even discovered a "Fashioncore" channel on Discord dedicated to sharing mech and decal designs.

## The Dilemma

However, a nagging issue became apparent: the lack of a centralized platform for sharing and discovering mech and decal designs. Countless remarkable designs were scattered across multiple Discord channels and subreddit posts, making them frustratingly difficult to locate. Scrolling through endless messages and posts in search of a design I'd seen days ago was a task I hoped to simplify.

## Crafting a Solution

With the launch of Armored Core VI, I sensed a burgeoning demand for a solution to this dilemma. Thus, I embarked on a journey to build a platform that would bring mech and decal design enthusiasts together.

## The Tech Stack

In my quest to create this platform, I delved into extensive research on the project's architecture. I scoured numerous starter templates on Vercel and Github but found my ideal match in [Giga Stack](https://giga-stack.vercel.app), an inspiration from the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and [Shadcn Taxonomy](https://tx.shadcn.com/). 

During that night, I established the repository, set up essential connections to Planetscale for database management and Clerk for authentication, and successfully deployed it on Vercel. As the clock struck midnight, I headed to bed, eagerly anticipating the day ahead.

## Conclusion

The transition from my old job to this new project has been nothing short of exhilarating. Stay tuned for updates on this endeavor, and I invite you to share your thoughts and ideas as we embark on this exciting journey together.
