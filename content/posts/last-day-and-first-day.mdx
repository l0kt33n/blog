On Friday, I closed the door on an enriching three-year chapter in my career. It was a journey filled with valuable lessons and collaboration with brilliant minds. Interestingly, my departure coincided with the much-anticipated release of [Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon](https://playarmoredcore.com/), a game that had captured my attention since FromSoftware's previous masterpiece, Elden Ring. I had pre-ordered Armored Core VI the moment it was announced, and now, I had all the time I needed to dive into this thrilling gaming adventure.

## Exploring Armored Core VI

Armored Core VI shines with its intricate mech customization, allowing players to fine-tune their mechs with diverse weaponry, armor, and unique components. The game also offers the artistic freedom to adorn your mech with custom paint jobs and decals.

As someone who admittedly lacks artistic prowess, I turned to the online community for decals. I stumbled upon impressive designs within the [ArmoredCore Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/armoredcore/) and even found a dedicated "Fashioncore" Discord channel for mech and decal enthusiasts.

## The Challenge

A glaring issue soon became apparent: the absence of a centralized platform for sharing and discovering mech and decal designs. Countless exceptional designs were scattered across various Discord channels and subreddit posts, making it a frustrating endeavor to find specific creations. The endless scrolling in search of a design I had glimpsed days ago had to be simplified.

## Crafting the Solution

With the Armored Core VI launch igniting immense interest, I recognized an opportunity to address this challenge. Thus, I embarked on a mission to create a platform that would unite mech and decal design enthusiasts.

## The Tech Stack

As I ventured into this project, I delved into in-depth research on the project's architecture. I explored numerous starter templates on Vercel and Github before discovering the perfect fit: [Giga Stack](https://giga-stack.vercel.app), inspired by the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and [Shadcn Taxonomy](https://tx.shadcn.com/). 

In one evening, I set up the repository, established vital connections with Planetscale for database management and Clerk for authentication, and deployed it seamlessly on Vercel. As midnight approached, I retired to bed, eagerly anticipating the day ahead.

## In Conclusion

The transition from my old job to this new project has been exhilarating. Stay tuned for updates on this journey, and I welcome your insights and ideas as we embark on this exciting path together.
