## Day 1, Hour 0

Waking up with determination, I embarked on the thrilling challenge of building an MVP in a single day. This post recounts my journey, highlighting key tasks, technology choices, and insights gained along the way.

## Task List

1. **Public Homepage Feed**: Implement a feed displaying posts from all users.
2. **Sign Up and Login Pages**: Create user authentication flows.
3. **User Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for users to manage their posts.
4. **Modals for Post Management**: Design modals for creating and editing posts.
5. **About Page**: Craft an informative about page.
6. **Metadata Customization**: Replace default metadata with custom branding.

## The CRUD

While this project involved technologies like TRPC, zod, and DrizzleORM, unfamiliarity didn't slow me down. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I set up basic CRUD operations. Aligning types across the frontend and backend was the most challenging part, but simplicity remained a priority. For the MVP, I focused solely on creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.

## The Frontend

Leveraging Shadcn's UI library for the frontend streamlined the layout creation process. Next.js 13's `layout` files simplified maintaining consistency across pages. I only needed to import the header and footer components into the `RootLayout` within `app/layout.tsx`.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
	return (
		<html lang="en">
			<head />
			<ClientProviders>
				<body
					className={cn(
						'antialiased bg-white text-black dark:bg-stone-900 dark:text-white',
						fontSans.className
					)}
				>
					<Analytics />
					<ThemeProvider
						attribute="class"
						defaultTheme="system"
						enableSystem
					>
						<Toaster />
						<header className="grid gap-4 text-center py-2 md:py-4 border-b">
						</header>
						<main className="min-h-screen">{children}</main>
						<footer className="bg-background text-white">
							<div className="grid md:flex container md:items-center md:justify-between gap-2 md:gap-4 py-2 md:py-6 text-sm">
								<p>
									Built with &#128150; by{' '}
									<a
										href={siteConfig.links.github}
										target="_blank"
										rel="noreferrer"
										className="font-semibold underline underline-offset-4"
									>
										@l0kt33n
									</a>
								</p>
							</div>
						</footer>
					</ThemeProvider>
				</body>
			</ClientProviders>
		</html>
	);
}
```

## The Homepage

The homepage's design received meticulous attention. I opted for a grid-based gallery view to display user-generated content, aiming for a one-stop-shop experience. Mobile responsiveness was crucial, achieved through a single-column layout on mobile devices.

## MVP Completion

By 10 PM, the MVP was ready for deployment. A few mobile layout tweaks and it was production-ready. However, the empty site needed content. I added approximately 20 posts to provide an initial user experience.

Deployment was a breeze on Vercel, from domain purchase to enabling Vercel Analytics. If I had chosen manual AWS hosting, the process might have taken significantly longer.

I shared the link with the Armored Core community on Discord and Reddit, eagerly awaiting their feedback.

As I checked the website and engaged with the community on my phone before sleep, I couldn't help but feel excited about the next day's possibilities.

Stay tuned for more on this exciting journey!
